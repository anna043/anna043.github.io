Hello! I am a student at Cal State Fullerton. I am currently majoring in Mathematics and wanted to dabble in computer science.

## Favorite CPSC 120 Labs
*Lab 1

  Lab one was fun because it was my first time using C++ language. I took Python in high school, so it was interesting to see the similarities and differences. The first lab taught me useful information about github including how to git add, git commit, and git pull/push. 

*Lab 3 Part 1
  
  This lab is one I wanted to reflect on as it was rather difficult to understand at the time, but now I understand the code a lot better. Lab 3 was fun as we were able to use calculations within our code and was a nice introduction to functions. 

*Lab 4 Part 2 

  I really enjoyed working on lab 4 because I have always wondered how guessing games worked online. While the concept is simple, it was nice to see the code behind the game. This lab helped me understand how to use nested loops and solidified my understanding of std::cin and std::cout.
